## Hello, my name is [Daniel Jaramillo](https://d4nielj.me/links)

<p>I’m a Web Developer who wants to work on projects that matter. I’m also very passionate about aesthetics, branding, and advertising which helps me build outstanding User Interfaces and Experiences. My list of skills includes JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and much more.</p>


<p>On top of this, my previous degree in Advertising and Graphic Design is of great help to keep my clients on my mind and provide them with an amazing user experience, bringing greater value to the product on development and the overall brand.</p>


<p>During the last year, I had the marvelous experience of learning how to develop software at <a href="https://www.microverse.org/" target="_blank">Microverse</a>, an online training school. But it is more than just that. I also learned how to work remotely and collaboratively. In this school, I coded every day with other developers around the world and have learned the important skills of communication and teamwork.</p>
